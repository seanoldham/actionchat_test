# ActionCable Chat

This application is a short demonstration on how to use ActionCable, a feature of the upcoming Ruby on Rails 5.0.
It runs a simple multi-user chat which will update automatically once a message is posted.

See the accompanying blog post

To get started do

```
bundle install

rails s

bin/cable # in another tab/window of your terminal
```
